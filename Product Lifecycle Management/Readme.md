## Overview

The **Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Tool** is designed to assist supply chain teams in launching new products and managing them through their entire lifecycle. This tool work together with Power automate to send automated notifications based on custom preferences, built-in comment features, role-based security, status tracking, dynamic workflows, field validation, and attachment handling. The PLM tool streamlines the process of managing product requests and ensures seamless communication and collaboration across teams.

## Features

- **Automated Notifications**: Send notifications based on custom preferences, such as type of request, destination country, current stage, and manufacturing site..etc. Notifications are also sent for reminders and overdue tasks.
- **Built-in Comments**: Collate all communication in one spot, capturing the date and time, allowing teams to easily access previous comments and add clarifying information.
- **Role-Based Security**: Implement role-based security across the 10 stages to ensure only users with the correct access can view all data, protecting confidential information.
- **Status Tracker**: Easily see the status of the request with a built-in tracker.
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Create multiple workflows that dynamically open up based on the selection of different forms or fields, making data entry easy.
- **Field Validation**: Implement validation across fields to ensure data accuracy.
- **Attachments**: Add attachments to the application with comments.
- **Admin Control**: Admins can move the PLM request across various stages in case of issues, rather than having to move things step by step.
- **Watch List**: Add colleagues to a watch list to keep them updated on the progress of the PLM request through automated notifications.
